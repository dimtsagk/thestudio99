# thestudio99
## My first HTML page in College. 

It's supposed to be a web page for an FM radio in Athens, Greece, playing mainstream music. I created the website with some specific requirements (table, contact form etc.), to pass the HTML course. 
- Technologies used: CSS, HTML, BootStrap, JavaScript, jQuery.
